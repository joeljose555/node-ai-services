Result: Input: Israeli forces killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including 10 waiting for aid, on Friday. The UN reported nearly 800 people killed trying to access food in Gaza since late May, with most deaths occurring near facilities operated by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF called the UN report \"false and misleading,\" claiming that \"most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to UN convoys.\" Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza are stalling over the extent of Israeli forces' withdrawal from the Palestinian territory.","timestamp":"2025-07-19T20:28:01.753Z"}

The UK has two definitions of drought: meteorological and hydrological. In meteorological terms, it refers to a sustained period of dry weather, while in hydrology, it is a lack of water resources. Droughts tend to occur following drier periods due to the lag between rain falling and it getting through river systems and into storage. Since the start of the latest hydrolographical year in October 2024, and up to the end of June 2025, rainfall has been approximately 20% below average, making it one of the driest periods since the infamous 1976 drought. The 2024/2025 hydrological year has been around 20% below average, with droughts and hosepipe bans being introduced. The last significant hosepipe ban in the UK was in the record-breaking summer of 2022. The UN has recorded nearly 800 people killed trying to access food in Gaza since late May, when Israel began easing a more than two-month blockade on deliveries.

Result: Input: Israeli forces killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including 10 who were waiting for aid, on Friday. The UN reported nearly 800 people killed trying to access food in Gaza since late May, when Israel began easing a two-month blockade on deliveries. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and frequent reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations. A man named Fanta fled along one of the world's most dangerous smuggling routes, hoping to reach Saudi Arabia. He was arrested and sent to a migrant detention center in northern Yemen. In 2024, the U.N. recorded over 60,000 migrants arriving in Yemen from the Horn of Africa. When multiple 250-pound bombs hit the prison on April 28, tearing through the roof, Mr. Fanta survived with two broken legs and a broken arm. A derelict tenement building in Glasgow collapsed, causing nearby homes to be evacuated. The building has been lying derelict for about five years after being gutted by a fire during lockdown. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent eight appliances to the scene, but there were no reports of injuries.

This year's events are held at 18 locations, with members traveling to converge with neighboring lodges at the nearest host venue. The Twelfth celebrations generations in the making, with hundreds of bonfires lit to mark Eleventh Night, a tradition observed by many unionist communities on the eve of the Twelfth. The UK has been experiencing a severe drought, with rainfall running approximately 20% below average since the start of the latest hydrological year in October 2024. The Environment Agency has stated that some areas are either in drought or a state of prolonged dry weather, and the National Drought Group will meet on Tuesday to discuss the latest situation. Factors such as population growth, urban expansion, changes in water usage over time, and rainfall totals are all contributing factors to the drought. The UK has experienced a dry spring and start to summer, with rainfall running approximately 20% below average since the start of the latest hydrological year in October 2024. This is one of the driest periods since the infamous 1976 drought. The last significant hosepipe ban in the UK was in the record-breaking summer of 2022, which affected nearly 20 million households.

The Trump administration faces doubts about its ability to strike trade deals that would open up markets, as they have only announced two preliminary deals with Britain and Vietnam. The administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way. President Trump's goal of opening global markets was initially believed to be achieved by imposing sweeping global tariffs in April. However, three months later, doubts are growing that his administration will ever strike the kind of trade deals that would open up markets. The administration has only announced two preliminary deals, with Britain and Vietnam, and the status of the Vietnam deal is now in question. The Trump administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The UK has two definitions of drought: meteorological and hydrological. In meteorological terms, it refers to a sustained period of dry weather, while in hydrology, it is a lack of water resources. Droughts tend to occur following drier periods due to the lag between rain falling and it getting through river systems and into storage. Since the start of the latest hydrolographical year in October 2024, and up to the end of June 2025, rainfall has been approximately 20% below average, making it one of the driest periods since the infamous 1976 drought. The 2024/2025 hydrological year has started around 20% below average, with droughts and hosepipe bans being introduced.

President Trump has faced doubts about his goal of using his tariffs as a lever to open up global markets, as some investors and supporters believe he is content with punishing levies instead.

The administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way. The Trump administration may have the capacity to deal with only a fraction of the countries that have sought out meetings with U.S. officials, and some governments have not been able to schedule them. The Trump administration has only announced two preliminary trade deals, with Britain and Vietnam, and the status of the Vietnam deal is now in question.

The administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way. UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles. Israel's military said it had worked to minimise \"possible friction between the population and the (army) as much as possible.\" Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza are stalling over the extent of Israeli forces' withdrawal from the Palestinian territory. Hamas has rejected the withdrawal maps which Israel has proposed, as they would leave about 40% of the territory under Israeli control.

Result: Input: Israeli forces killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including 10 who were waiting for aid, on Friday. The UN reported nearly 800 people killed trying to access food in Gaza since late May, when Israel began easing a two-month blockade on deliveries. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and frequent reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations. A man named Fanta fled along one of the world's most dangerous smuggling routes, hoping to reach Saudi Arabia. He was arrested and sent to a migrant detention center in northern Yemen. In 2024, the U.N. recorded over 60,000 migrants arriving in Yemen from the Horn of Africa. When multiple 250-pound bombs hit the prison on April 28, tearing through the roof, Mr. Fanta survived with two broken legs and a broken arm. A derelict tenement building in Glasgow collapsed, causing nearby homes to be evacuated. The building has been lying derelict for about five years after being gutted by a fire during lockdown. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent eight appliances to the scene, but there were no reports of injuries.

The Twelfth of July is the largest day in the Orange Order's marching calendar, with thousands of Orange Order members participating in annual parades across Northern Ireland to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. The event is also a celebration of Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage. This year's events are held at 18 locations, with members traveling to converge with neighboring lodges at the nearest host venue. The Twelfth celebrations generations in the making, with hundreds of bonfires lit to mark Eleventh Night, a tradition observed by many unionist communities on the eve of the Twelfth. The UK has been experiencing a severe drought, with rainfall running approximately 20% below average since the start of the latest hydrological year in October 2024. The Environment Agency has stated that some areas are either in drought or a state of prolonged dry weather, and the National Drought Group will meet on Tuesday to discuss the latest situation. Factors such as population growth, urban expansion, changes in water usage over time, and rainfall totals are all contributing factors to the drought. The UK has experienced a dry spring and start to summer, with rainfall running approximately 20% below average since the start of the latest hydrological year in October 2024. This is one of the driest periods since the infamous 1976 drought. The last significant hosepipe ban in the UK was in the record-breaking summer of 2022, which affected nearly 20 million households.

The Trump administration faces doubts about its ability to strike trade deals that would open up markets, as they have only announced two preliminary deals with Britain and Vietnam. The administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way. President Trump's goal of opening global markets was initially believed to be achieved by imposing sweeping global tariffs in April. However, three months later, doubts are growing that his administration will ever strike the kind of trade deals that would open up markets. The administration has only announced two preliminary deals, with Britain and Vietnam, and the status of the Vietnam deal is now in question. The Trump administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Result: Input: A mother of five, Jacque White, survived the flood in Central Texas and returned to her flooded cabin in Kerr County, Texas, to assess the damage. She and her children, aged 5, 7, 10, 11, and 13, managed to evacuate their small cabin near the Guadalupe River and found it in ruins. The Fourth of July floods have been among the deadliest for children, killing dozens, many of them girls from Camp Mystic, and more than 120 people overall. Jaque White, a mother of five, stopped her minivan near a pile of debris near the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, Texas, after the Fourth of July floods in Central Texas killed dozens of children, many of them girls from Camp Mystic. She managed to evacuate her children from their small cabin near the spot where they had lived since her divorce three years ago. The floods have been among the deadliest for children, with scores still missing. White and her children were unable to return to their cabin due to the damage caused by the floods. A federal judge in New Hampshire, Joseph N. Laplante, has embraced class actions, opening a new front in the battle to deny President Trump's effort to redefine who can become a citizen. The judge provisionally certified a class of all children born to parents who are in the United States temporarily or without authorization, and entered a preliminary injunction in their favor barring the enforcement of Mr. Trump's ban on birthright citizenship. The move was also a new sign that Mr. Immigrant workers in Pasadena, Altadena, and Pacific Palisades have been playing a crucial role in the recovery of areas affected by the Los Angeles wildfires. They have decontaminated homes, cleaned smoke-affected homes, and begun reconstruction in the months since the fires. However, on a recent day, federal immigration agents detained six people outside a Winchell's Donut House, prompting the day laborers to go home instead of heading to their job sites. Israeli forces killed at least 30 people in Gaza, including 10 waiting for aid, on Friday. The UN reported nearly 800 people killed trying to access food in Gaza since late May, with most deaths occurring near facilities operated by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF called the UN report \"false and misleading,\" claiming that \"most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to UN convoys.\" Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza are stalling over the extent of Israeli forces' withdrawal from the Palestinian territory. Fanta Ali Ahmed, a migrant from Ethiopia, was trapped with over 100 others in a rickety prison in northern Yemen. After civil war reached his home region in 2020, he had fled along one of the world's most dangerous smuggling routes. He had hoped to reach Saudi Arabia, across the Red Sea. Instead, he was arrested and sent to a migrant detention center in Yemen. In 2024, the U.N. recorded over 60,000 migrants arriving in Yemen from the Horn of Africa.

Result: Input: Officials in Texas are under scrutiny for refusing to fund early warning systems for flash floods in an area where sudden, intense rainfall is frequent. These measures could have included river gauges and warning sirens that could have alerted people that their lives were in imminent danger. The floods that raged down the Guadalupe River eight days ago killed at least 121 people, including at least 36 children. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science discovered a 70 million-year-old dinosaur fossil buried 763 feet below the surface during a drilling project to better understand the geology of the Denver Basin. The discovery highlights the difficulty of predicting and preventing disasters, such as flash floods, which are becoming more common due to climate change. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science discovered a 70 million-year-old dinosaur fossil buried 763 feet below the surface of one of its parking lots. The fossil was discovered during a drilling project aimed at better understanding the geology of the Denver Basin. The museum plans to replace natural gas with geothermal systems to heat and cool the museum. Archaeologists discovered a 1,700-year-old Maya ruler's tomb in Caracol, Belize, containing a rare mosaic death mask, jadeite jewelry, shells from the Pacific, and elaborate designs on pottery and bone. The tomb was the first ever found at Caricol and held clues to a Mesoamerican world where cities contended with one another from hundreds of miles apart.

The temperature in Glasgow reached 27C on day one, with forecasts of even higher temperatures to come over the weekend. Organizers are urging fans to stay cool during the heatwave. Lord Huron's song \"The Night We Met\" has become a 10-year-old sleeper hit, with almost a billion streams on Spotify in 2024 alone. The song was written as a wistful reflection of a relationship and has since gained popularity, surpassing Taylor Swift's \"Houdini\" and Beyonc√©'s \"Texas Hold 'Em.\" The song's popularity has snowballed in recent years and shows no signs of slowing down. Beyonc√© and Dua Lipa may be two of the world's top pop stars, but their biggest songs in 2024 did not match the popularity of a 10-year-old track by Lord Huron, according to the official Billboard global end-of-year singles chart. Charli XCX may have ruled Brat summer, but her biggest hit still wasn't as big as The Night We Met, a song that has racked up three billion Spotify plays. The Night You Met was 35th on Billboard's global chart for 2024, above Dua's Houdini at 37 and Beyonc√©'s Texas Hold 'Em at 41. A mystery interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, discovered last week by astronomers, could be the oldest known comet, according to scientists. It is believed to have originated in the Milky Way's \"thick disk,\" a group of ancient stars that orbit above and below the area where the Sun and most stars are located. The team believes that because 3I-Atlas probably formed around an old star, it is made up of a lot of water ice, which could create a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year. The researchers made their findings using a model developed by Matthew Hopkins, a University of Oxford astronomer. A mystery interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, discovered by astronomers last week, could be the oldest known comet, according to scientists. It is three billion years older than our own solar system and is believed to have formed around an old star. The object is currently visible only with very large telescopes and is about the distance of Jupiter from Earth. The researchers believe that because 3I-Atlas probably formed around a star, it is made up of a lot of water ice, which could create a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year.
