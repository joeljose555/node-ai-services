  "summary": "People waiting for aid among dozens reported killed by Israeli forces in Gaza – Middle East crisis live: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 30 people on Friday, including 10 who were waiting for aid in the south of the war-ravaged territory, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.Gaza civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir said that 10 people were shot by Israeli forces on Friday while waiting for supplies in the Al-Shakoush area northwest of Rafah, where there have been repeated reports of deadly fire on aid seekers.The latest deaths came as the UN said nearly 800 people had been killed trying to access food in Gaza since late May, when Israel began easing a more than two-month blockade on deliveries.UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said most of the deaths occurred near facilities operated by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)“We’ve recorded now 798 killings, including 615 in the vicinity of the GHF sites,” from the time the group’s operations began in late May until 7 July, Shamdasani said on Friday.An officially private effort, GHF operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and frequent reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations.UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles.Responding to the UN’s figures, Israel’s military said it had worked to minimise “possible friction between the population and the (army) as much as possible”.It said: Following incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted... and instructions were issued to forces in the field following lessons learned. GHF called the UN report “false and misleading”, claiming that “most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to UN convoys”. Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza are stalling over the extent of Israeli forces’ withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, Palestinian and Israeli sources familiar with the negotiations in Doha told Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP).The sources said the indirect talks over a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire are expected to continue despite the latest obstacles. Delegations from both sides began discussions in Qatar last Sunday to try to agree on a temporary halt to the 21-month conflict sparked by Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.A Palestinian source told Reuters on Saturday that Hamas has rejected the withdrawal maps which Israel has proposed, as they would leave about 40% of the territory under Israeli control, including all of the southern area of Rafah and further territories in northern and eastern Gaza.Two Israeli sources told Reuters that Hamas wants Israel to retreat to lines it held in a previous ceasefire before it renewed its offensive in March.The Palestinian source said matters regarding aid and guarantees for ending the war were also presenting a challenge, and added that the crisis may be resolved with more US intervention.Another Palestinian source told AFP that mediators had asked both sides to postpone the talks until the arrival of US president Donald Trump’s special...\nThey Fled War in Ethiopia.

He was injured in April in the bombing of a migrant detention center in Saada, Yemen.Credit...Shuaib Almosawa for The New York TimesSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTListen to this article · 10:20 min Learn moreShare full articleBy Shuaib Almosawa and Vivian NereimShuaib Almosawa reported from Saada, Yemen, and Vivian Nereim from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.July 12, 2025The men awoke in the middle of the night to the roar of warplanes.Fear was nothing new to Fanta Ali Ahmed, who was trapped with more than 100 migrants in a rickety prison. After civil war reached his home region of Tigray in Ethiopia in 2020, he had fled along one of the world’s most dangerous smuggling routes.He had hoped to reach Saudi Arabia, across the Red Sea. Instead, as he passed through Yemeni territory ruled by the Houthi militia, he was arrested and sent to a migrant detention center in northern Yemen.For weeks in March and April of this year, he heard American airstrikes nearby, targeting Yemen in a campaign against the Houthis, who are backed by Iran. But this was the closest the planes had ever come. Common migration routes to Saudi Arabia from Ethiopia In 2024, the U.N. recorded more than 60,000 migrants arriving in Yemen from the Horn of Africa.

By Daniel Wood When multiple 250-pound bombs hit the prison on April 28, tearing through the roof, Mr. Fanta fell to the ground, he recalled. At first, he thought he was the only one hurt. He later realized that he was one of the luckier ones. Ten people close to him were killed, while others were left with limbs hanging by shredded skin, he said.“The place and everyone in it were mangled,” said Mr. Fanta, 32, who survived with two broken legs and a broken arm. “I don’t know why America bombed us.”<div class=\"css-7axq9l\" data-testid=\"optimistic-truncator-noscript\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"css-1b5b8u1\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg><div data-testid=\"optimistic-truncator-noscript-message\" class=\"css-6yo1no\"><p class=\"css-3kpklk\" data-tpl=\"t\">We are having trouble retrieving the article content.</p><p class=\"css-3kpklk\" data-tpl=\"t\">Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.</p></div></div>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The building at the corner of Kenmure Street and Albert Drive in Pollockshields came crashing down shortly after midnight. Former River City actor and musician Tom Urie, who was walking past at the time said he had a lucky escape, likening it to an \"Indiana Jones movie\". The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said it sent eight appliances to the scene, but there were no reports of injuries. The building has been lying derelict for about five years after it was gutted by a fire during lockdown. Urie, who lives locally, described how he was returning home from a party moments before it fell down.\"I started hearing weird noises and at first I thought there were people in there smashing things up,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \"I thought it was a weird time of night to be demolishing something.\"It became apparent that something awful was about to happen so I got across the street and turned round and saw the whole façade of the building collapse.\"Footage on social media shows the immediate aftermath of the collapseMobile phone footage recorded by Urie shows dust clouds drifting down the street after the Kenmure Street side crumbled and the walls on Albert Drive were left \"hanging by a thread\". Urie, who played \"Big Bob\" O'Hara in River City, described how instinctively he ran for his life. \"I realised I hadn't run since I was eight so it felt like a rather overweight 56-year-old Indiana Jones running away from a collapsing building.\"I was quite frightened, but it was also a shame because it was such a gorgeous old tenement.\"More stories from Glasgow & West ScotlandMore stories from ScotlandThe tenement block was one of two buildings badly damaged by fire within months of each other on the same crossroads several years ago. Urie said the burnt-out shell was fenced off and there was no access to the pavement but there had been local concern about its safety for some time. \"We've all been really worried because it looks unsafe and it has been sitting there for such a long time without anybody doing anything,\" he said. A spokesperson for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: \"A number of nearby residences were evacuated as firefighters worked to make the building safe\". The last firefighters left the scene at about 03:00. The area was fenced off on Saturday morning while officials inspected the site.

Thousands of Orange Order members take part in the annual marches to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.The event is also a celebration of Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage.Members of local Orange lodges are joined on parade by visiting lodges from Scotland and further afield. PA MediaMembers of a marching band wait on the street in north Belfast for the main parade to startThe main parade has begun walking from the Orange hall at Clifton Street in north Belfast. A small feeder parade passed the Ardoyne shops in north Belfast at 09:00 BST without issue. There was a small police presence at the shops, which in the past was the scene of parade-related trouble.It is not permitted on the same route this evening, but the return parade will take place on Sunday morning. PA MediaPeople at Clifton Street Orange Hall getting ready for the Twelfth of July parade The Orange lodges are accompanied by marching bands and supported by tens of thousands of spectators, many of whom have dressed up in colourful costume for the occasion. This year's events are concentrated at 18 locations, with members travelling to converge with neighbouring lodges at the nearest host venue. This year marks the 335th anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, which took place outside Drogheda in what is now the Republic of Ireland.

Most Eleventh Night bonfires pass without incident, but some are controversial due to their height or location, or because they contain symbols considered offensive.This year a bonfire in south Belfast caused concern because of the presence of asbestos on the site, and the fact it was close to an electricity substation which supplies power to two nearby hospitals.The bonfire, between the Donegall Road and the Westlink, was lit on Friday night after police confirmed they would not assist in removing it.

When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.Even after President Trump announced sweeping global tariffs in April, some investors and supporters comforted themselves by arguing that the president’s goal was still to open global markets, not close them off.The belief, promoted by Mr. Trump himself, was that he was using his tariffs as a lever to crack open foreign markets and the administration would soon deliver dozens of deals that would increase U.S. exports and help American businesses flourish abroad.Three months later, that optimism is being replaced by doubts that Mr. Trump’s goal was ever to strike the kind of trade deals that would open up markets. When Mr. Trump paused his global tariffs for 90 days in April, he said the delay would give his administration time to reach trade deals with countries across the world. In the intervening months, Mr. Trump boasted about how countries were lining up to talk to the United States and at one point claimed he had reached 200 deals.But the administration has only announced two preliminary deals, with Britain and Vietnam, and the status of the Vietnam deal is now in question. While handshake agreements with the European Union, India, Taiwan and other governments could soon be pending, they are likely to be limited pacts that leave much left to be negotiated. Even when deals have been announced, the administration has left double-digit tariffs in place, with the promise of more levies on foreign products on the way.This week, Mr. Trump sent out nearly two dozen letters notifying countries of the high tariff rates they will be charged as of Aug. 1 if they don’t sign trade deals. That included nations that were in active negotiations with the United States, like Indonesia, Canada, South Korea and Malaysia.With less than a month before the Aug. 1 tariffs kick in, the Trump administration may have the capacity to deal with only a fraction of those countries.
