The floods that raged down the Guadalupe River eight days ago killed at least 121 people, including at least 36 children.But global experts in early warning systems said that there are few examples of places around the world that have mastered the choreography of forecasting and communication needed to prevent loss of life in extreme rain events. And in many cases, like in Texas this month, accurate forecasting alone is not enough to prevent calamity.“Flash floods are the hardest kind of disaster to prevent,” said Erin Coughlan de Perez, who studies disaster risk management at Tufts University. She said that both rich and poor countries have grappled with funding for systems that ultimately either fail or create enough false alarms to erode public confidence.For instance, in Valencia, Spain, a lack of sufficient warnings contributed to a catastrophe where more than 200 people died in flash floods last year. An alert system was in place, but was not activated until it was already too late.“When the alert came, my grandpa had already drowned,” one resident told The Times.“There’s a major ‘cry wolf’ issue because flash floods are so hard to predict,” Dr. Coughlan de Perez said. “And they are pretty infrequent in most places, so it’s hard to motivate investment.

The museum wanted to understand the geology to see if it would be possible to replace natural gas with geothermal systems to heat and cool the museum.Two drilling rigs bore test holes under one of the museum’s paved parking lots, reaching almost 1,000 feet below the surface.On Jan. 30, one of the museum’s geologists, who was sifting through what had been extracted, immediately recognized the dinosaur bone, sending museum staff members into a frenzy.James Hagadorn, the museum’s curator of geology, stepped out of a parent-teacher conference as his phone lit up with texts.<div class=\"css-7axq9l\" data-testid=\"optimistic-truncator-noscript\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"css-1b5b8u1\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg><div data-testid=\"optimistic-truncator-noscript-message\" class=\"css-6yo1no\"><p class=\"css-3kpklk\" data-tpl=\"t\">We are having trouble retrieving the article content.</p><p class=\"css-3kpklk\" data-tpl=\"t\">Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.</p></div></div>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.The archaeologists worked in the shadow of towering Maya ruins, piercing the floor of a structure they had searched years before.Below, they found an even more ancient chamber, still holding a body and the treasures it was buried with: a rare mosaic death mask and jadeite jewelry, shells from the Pacific and elaborate designs on pottery and bone.It was the 1,700-year-old tomb of a Maya ruler — the first ever found at Caracol, the largest Maya site in Belize — and it held clues to a Mesoamerican world where cities contended with one another from hundreds of miles apart.“They’ve found a very early ruler, so that’s very important, and he’s claimed to be the founder of a dynasty,” said Gary Feinman, an archaeologist at Field Museum of Chicago who was not involved in the excavation. “That’s a major find.”Arlen Chase, one of the archaeologists working at Caracol, was among the first to enter the tomb. “As soon as we saw the chamber, we knew we had something,” he said.From the style of ceramic vessels, he knew the tomb was exceptionally old. From the red cinnabar all around, he knew it was for someone of very high status.<div class=\"css-7axq9l\" data-testid=\"optimistic-truncator-noscript\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"css-1b5b8u1\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg><div data-testid=\"optimistic-truncator-noscript-message\" class=\"css-6yo1no\"><p class=\"css-3kpklk\" data-tpl=\"t\">We are having trouble retrieving the article content.</p><p class=\"css-3kpklk\" data-tpl=\"t\">Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.</p></div></div>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

This is a group of ancient stars that orbit above and below the area where the Sun and most stars are located.The top view of the Milky Way, below, gives a sense of the object's path around our galaxy. The estimated orbits of 3I/Atlas are in red and those of our Sun are in yellow. Matthew HopkinsThe estimated orbits around the Milk Way of the object, in red, and our Sun, in yellowThe team believe that because 3I/Atlas probably formed around an old star, it is made up of a lot of water ice.That means that as it approaches the Sun later this year, the energy from the Sun will heat the object's surface, leading to blazes of vapour and dust.That could create a glowing tail.The researchers made their findings using a model developed by Mr Hopkins.\"This is an object from a part of the galaxy we've never seen up close before,\" said Prof Chris Lintott, co-author of the study.\"We think there's a two-thirds chance this comet is older than the solar system, and that it's been drifting through interstellar space ever since.\"Interstellar objects form around other stars, at the start of those stars' lives, explains Mr Hopkins.\"This connection back to their parent stars means that we can look at the stellar population of the Milky Way,\" he adds.Later this year, 3I/Atlas should be visible from Earth using amateur telescopes.Before 3I/Atlas soared into view, just two others had been seen. One was called 1I/'Oumuamua,...\nBBC Inside Science: Solutions to plastic waste from creating cleaner products to cleaning up ocean litter.
